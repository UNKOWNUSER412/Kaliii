I'm gonna crash with a friend upstate.
I'm gonna eat.
I'm gonna fix the world I broke,
I'm gonna get him a job at Evil Corp.
I'm gonna get off at the next stop.
I'm gonna go grab my shit and come back.
I'm gonna head up to the office.
I'm gonna lose my brother.
I'm gonna need the keys.
I'm gonna ride the

I'm headed to JFK in 20.
I'm here now.
I'm here to discuss the

I might have an angle.
I might've chosen the wrong candidate.
I'm... I'm backlogged here, man.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm in.
I miss being a part of something.
I'm joking, dickface.
I'm just...
I'm just a brave traveler
I'm just growing up.
I'm just helping him
I'm just here to make it scandal-free.
I'm just on autopilot,
I'm just tired.
I'm just trying to brighten up your day
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving. I have to catch my bus.
I'm like a Sam Kinison stand-up bit,
I'm listening.
I'm literally looking
I'm looking at the floor plan
I'm looking for a mosque.
 I'm losing you 
I'm making it look like
immediately, so I got it done.
I'm messing with you.
I'm more interested
I'm Mr. Williams.
I'm narrowing the gap, but still,
I'm not a source anymore.
I'm not being overly
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going to talk to you
I'm not gonna be strong-armed,
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna trip
I'm not here to give you any trouble.
I'm not keeping
I'm no traitor.
I'm not stupid. I never sent the email.
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm not sure he wants to,
I'm not sure I understand.
I'm not talking about ribs.
I'm not the only one under their thumb.
I'm not trying to destroy you.
I'm not trying to escape.
I'm not trying to scare you.
I'm not wanted for the
impassioned plea
I'm picking him up from school today.
Impressive.
 I'm pullin' my gat
I'm pushing him along.
I'm real 
I'm really glad I met you tonight.
I'm really off today.
I'm really starting to lose it.
I'm right behind you.
I'm running out of options.
I'm searching for.
I'm sending shipping requests
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, bro. I
I'm sorry, how did you
I'm sorry, I don't know if I can say it.
I'm sorry if I misled you
I'm sorry, Mister, uh...
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson,
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, you are?
I'm still attracting attention.
I'm stuck between floors 26 and 25.
I'm supposed to be on
I'm sure we can arrange a deal.
I'm surprised you agreed to meet.
I'm surprised you came.
I'm taking over. So, no.
I'm taking the subway. So what?
I'm talking to right now,
I'm talking to right now.
I'm the one in control.
I'm the one to blame.

I'm trying to get you out of this alive.
I'm trying to help him.
I'm trying to show you.
I must have been right.
I'm working with the FBI.
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried she's a flight risk.

It's about him.
It's about how one mistake
It's about making them better.
It's about the anonymous
It's about the principle.
It's about to be burned anyway.
It's actually just right back there.
It's a figure of speech.
It's all good with me.
It's all right here in my research.
It's all they know.
It's almost as if...
It's already served its purpose.
It's always better to see
It's a madhouse down here.
It's a nice rug.
It's an illusion.
It's another cipher code.

It's been really fun.
It's been three weeks.
It's better. For everyone.
It's bullshit.
it's clearly
It's cool.
It's Dark Army.
It's different.
It's done, but we got a problem.
It's downloaded.
It's easy for you to play
It's Elliot.
It's finally happening.
It's fine.
It's for us.
It's game over for me.
It's going to take forever
It's gonna be business as usual.
It's gonna be it for me.
It's gonna happen any second.
It's gonna work out
It's got to be. Keep looking.
It's happening.
It's hard to explain.
It's hard what he just did...
It's high time you guys start
It's him.
It's insane. Yeah, I know.
It's in your closet.
It's... it's... He's in good hands.
It's... it's safe to go back to work.

It's me they want, not you.
It's mind-boggling.
It's movie night. Is it the movie?
It's nasty stuff.
It's near a playground.
It's nice.
It's nice to finally meet you.
It's none of your business.
It's nonnegotiable.
It's not about the money.
It's not always permanent.
It's not even Halloween.
it's not gonna work out
It's not good.
it's not me.
It's not me he has to worry about.
It's not negotiable.
It's not over. It can't be.
It's not safe for you
It's not safe for you here.
It's not that.
It's not that I'm out of moves.
It's not that simple.
It's not why I exist.
It's okay.
It's okay if you do.
It's okay. I'll get it out of my system
It's okay. You can say it.
It's over.
It's over, DiPierro.
It's perfect. He will love it.
It's personal.
it's practically airborne.
It's precisely
It's probably dying.

It's what they're good at.
It's you.
It's yours.
It's you who's trying to stop our plan.
It takes a lot
it to our rendezvous.
it to stop this attack
It was a dig at me.
It was a figure of speech.
It was almost as if he
It was a moment of weakness.
It was cool. Got to stab up
It was Elliot. He was acting strange.
It was for us.
It was his
It was mine. All of it.
it was more important
It was Mr. Alderson's request.
It wasn't a single point of failure.
It wasn't me!
It wasn't Romero.
It wasn't until
It wasn't your fault.
It was one of those high-end
it was possible.
It was real.
It was released about an hour ago.
It was supposed to be only one
It was the best way to manage him.
It was the wishing.
It was to get access
It was you who exported the keys.
it will all get released.
it will continue to grow
It will draw too much attention.
It won't be long.
It won't happen again.
It won't make sense to you.
It won't work.
It would draw too much attention.
It would spook his connection to Tyrell.
I, uh...
I, um...
I, um... I need a minute.
I understand that you and your son
I understood your move.
I used to.
I used to do it as a child.
I've actually never had penetration, dude.
I've always told you
I've always wanted justice
I've been covering
I've been here four days by myself.
I've been looking for some time
I've been monitoring traffic at E Corp,
I've been reading online, and it seems
I've been thinking about
I've been waiting all night.
I've engineered a hack that
I've got 14 customers,
I've got a fire coming from
I've got eyes on the door.
I've got something for you.
I've hardened my install
I've just been sitting here,
I've known Angela
I've never been to the movies.
I've never been to this island.
I've never penetrated. I just... I...
I've only ever gotten laid twice.
I've told you that before.
I've wanted to see
I wake up in his SUV,
I wanna be sure too.
I wanna go home.
I wanna know who made that call.
I wanna make sure we do it right.
I wanna spend what time I have left
I want an invite.
I want confirmation.
I wanted to congratulate you in person.
I wanted to personally come
I wanted to say she was a good person.
I wanted you to feel what I felt.
I want him out, out!
I want it.
I want it shut down.
I want it to happen on
I want the contract
I want to be the one that finds them.
I want to get this in front of him.
I want to leave.
I want to see my wife. I demand it.
I want to take you home.
I want to understand you.
I want us to be a team.
I want us to keep talking.
I want your word.
I want you to back.
I want you to know she's innocent.
I want you to look at this jerk-off
I want you to stay with me tonight.
I was.
I was able to prove to my wife
I was a CyberPatriot finalist.
I was a friend of your brother.
I was angry.
I was asking about your phone call.
I was cruel to her
I was getting concerned about you.
I was gonna walk Flipper first.
I was, like, thinking of
I was lost...
I was made.
I was no supporter.
I wasn't in Friday. Where was I?
I wasn't pushed.
I was on my way
I was right.
I was scared.
I was sent here to confirm
I was standing in a room...
I was talking about.
I was the architect!
I was there.
I was thinking you guys
I was, um...
I was unlocking
I was wondering if you could
I was you years ago.
I went to one of those rub and tugs...
I went to school with your daughter.
I will fucking scream.
I will get to you in a moment.
I will go back to our partners
I will handle this.
I will not.
I will not take your CD this time.
I will now open the floor to
I wish Dad were here right now.
I wish I could have been
I wish I could say
I wish I could see
I wish that were true.
I wish you were dead!
I wondered if you'd make it today,
I won't be needing them anymore.
I won't go to them with
I work a little more subtly.
I worked so hard to procure for you.
I work with Craig on the Q4 push.
I worry that could
I would be able to stay here.
I would find a way to
I would have...
I would have come here with you,
I would have found another way.
I would like you to explore.
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't be surprised
I wouldn't have come
I wouldn't miss it.
I would want Elliot and Darlene
I would wish for a faster computer.
